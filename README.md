# Nix Monorepo

> This project has deep debts to Christine Dodrill's [blog](https://christine.website/) and to [Domen Ko≈æar](https://www.domenkozar.com)'s discussion of [Nix anti-patterns](https://nix.dev/anti-patterns/index.html).

This is a somewhat tongue-in-cheek project intended to show you how you might use Nix in a larger, multi-language project. Each of the language directories here contains a simple, "hello world"-style project for that language that provides both a Nix build (via `default.nix`) and a Nix shell (via `shell.nix`). The current languages:

* [Elixir](./elixir)
* [Go](./golang)
* [Rust](./rust)

A few characteristics of the project worth mentioning:

* This repo uses [Niv](https://github.com/nmattia/niv) to provide "pinned" versions of [nixpkgs](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs) and other repositories. I think that this approach is more declarative and "pure" than relying on `<nixpkgs>`.
* The [`nix`](./nix) directory provides not just the generated `sources.nix` and `sources.json` files that Niv relies upon, but also a central source of language-specific Nix functions and variables (e.g. `rust.nix`) that can then be used by the language-specific sub-projects.
