# Nix Monorepo

> This project has deep debts to Christine Dodrill's [blog](https://christine.website/), [Domen Ko≈æar](https://www.domenkozar.com)'s discussion of [Nix anti-patterns](https://nix.dev/anti-patterns/index.html), and Burke Libbey's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSW5DqTyfOI9sUvnFoCjBlQ).

This is a somewhat silly project intended to show you how you might use Nix in a larger, multi-language project. It's mostly a learning exercise for your truly. Each of the language directories here contains a simple, "hello world"-style project for that language that provides a Nix shell configuration (`shell.nix`). The current languages:

* [Elixir](./elixir)
* [Go](./golang)
* [Rust](./rust)

## Project specifics

A few characteristics of the project worth mentioning:

* This repo uses [Niv](https://github.com/nmattia/niv) to provide "pinned" versions of [nixpkgs](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs) and some other repositories. I think that this approach is more declarative and "pure" than relying on the oft-encountered `<nixpkgs>`.
* The [`nix`](./nix) directory provides not just the generated `sources.nix` and `sources.json` files that Niv relies upon, but also a central source of language-specific Nix functions and variables that can be used by the language-specific sub-projects. This reduces the amount of boilerplate that's necessary in project-specific Nix files.

## Project goal

The goal of this repo is mostly to provide an example of how one might structure a larger Nix project. I'm starting small with just shell configs, but eventually I'd like to:

* Expand the number of languages beyond the initial three (which were chosen simply because they're the languages I know best)
* Add Nix facilities for building the projects
* Add configs for building Docker images out of the projects
